In order to use this spool holder you will need:

1. A ziplock bag. Regular 2Kg spools will fit in "2 gallon bags" that
   can be widely found in grocery stores. However, standard ziplock
   bags are too thin to do a good job of keeping out humidity. If
   keeping filament dry is important to you, then purchase a 6mil
   ziplock bag online. A regular 2Kg spool will fit in a 12x15" 6mil
   bag.

2. PTFE tubing (with inside diameter of 2mm and outside diameter of
   4mm). Use enough tubing to go from the spool holder to the extruder
   motor.

3. Desiccant (optional). A few packets of desiccant will keep the
   filament dry. Look online to purchase desiccant packets that change
   color when they are saturated and that can be microwaved to reuse.

4. The printed parts from the [stl directory](../stl/). You will need
   two copies of the holder file (print the same holder object twice),
   one spindle, and one clip. If you are using a large filament spool
   (such as a "5lb spool") then use the holder-tall, spindle-wide, and
   clip-wide files.

### Assembling the printed parts

It is a good idea to assemble the printed parts without the spool
first as the printed parts may initially be tight.

Align the channels on the spindle with the protrusions on the holder
and insert the spindle into one of the holders. Then turn the spindle
30 degrees to lock the spindle into place.

Align the spindle channels with the protrusions on the second holder
such that the two holders are about 60 degrees out of alignment. Push
the holder onto the spindle and then twist the holder so that both
holders align. Once you've completed twisting the two holders into
alignment it should not be possible to further twist the two holders
in that direction. At this point the two holders and spindle should be
locked into place.

Attach the clip to the two holders - it should click into place. Then
push the ptfe tubing into the clip. The tubing should fit snugly and
pass far enough into the clip to be seen from the other side (but the
tubing should not go past the clip).

After completing the initial assembly and verifying that the pieces
fit together, it is time to assemble the pieces with the filament
spool. Keep the filament secure to the filament spool until you are
ready to feed the filament through the clip. Disassemble the spool
holder and then reassemble it with the spool on the spool holder.
Place the clip on the side of the spool holder so that the filament
will be pulled under the filament spool on its way to the printer.

Use a pair of scissors to cut 1mm from one bottom corner of a ziplock
bag. The hole should be just large enough for the filament to pass
through it. While the spool and spool holder are outside of the bag,
carefully pass the filament through the clip, through the inside of
the bag, through the hole in the corner of the bag, and then through
the ptfe tubing.

Then place the filament spool into the bag such that it is standing
within the bag (the seal should be at the top). Carefully push the
ptfe tubing into the clip until it is secure (as the ptfe tubing is
pushed towards the clip it should also pull the ziplock bag into the
clip).

Add desiccant to the bag and then seal it. Finally, feed the filament
from the ptfe tube to the printer's extruder motor.
