History of Zipspool releases.

Zipspool v2.1.0
===============

Available on 20210120:
* Update clip so that the tube can move sideways on a carriage.  This
  helps encourage the filament to pull directly from the spool, which
  can reduce the chance of crimping and reduce overall friction.

Zipspool v2.0.0
===============

Available on 20201117:
* Recommend larger holder size (180mm height) by default.
* Use a varying diameter for spindle.  This can reduce friction as the
  spool turns.
* Rework clip to fit ptfe tubing on both sides.  This reduces the
  chance of filament crimping as it enters the tube.

Zipspool v1.0.0
===============

Available on 20190128:
* Initial release.
