History of Zipspool releases.

Zipspool v2.1.0
===============

Available on 20210120:
* Update clip so that the tube fits into a carriage which can move
  sideways along the clip.  This encourages the filament to pull
  straight from the spool instead of at an angle.  This reduces
  friction as the spool turns and can reduce the chance of the
  filament crimping as it passes through the tube.

Zipspool v2.0.0
===============

Available on 20201117:
* Recommend larger holder size (180mm height) by default.
* Use a varying diameter for spindle.  This can reduce friction as the
  spool turns.
* Rework clip to fit ptfe tubing on both sides.  This reduces the
  chance of filament crimping as it enters the tube.

Zipspool v1.0.0
===============

Available on 20190128:
* Initial release.
